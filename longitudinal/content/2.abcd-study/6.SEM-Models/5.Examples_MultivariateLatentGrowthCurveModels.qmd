## Overview

In this example, we will utilize xxxxxx models to analyze xxxxxx obtained across multiple measurement occasions for a sample of youth participating in the ABCD Study. Our primary objective is to understand xxxxxx, while factoring in the clustered nature of observations within individuals over time. XXXX models facilitate this by xxxxx.

## Results
### Compute Multivariate Latent Growth Curve Model
This code performs multivariate latent growth curve to examine the reciprocal relationships between 'Height' and 'Weight' measurements across 3 annual visits. The model output is provided below, along with a summary of results. This approach xxxxx.

```{r}

# Convert to wide format if necessary
df_wide <- df_long %>%
    pivot_wider(names_from = event, values_from = c(height, weight), names_sep = "_")

# Specify the multivariate latent growth curve model
model <- "
  # Intercept and slope factors for variable 1 (height)
  i_var1 =~ 1*height_Baseline + 1*height_Year_1 + 1*height_Year_2 + 1*height_Year_3
  s_var1 =~ 0*height_Baseline + 1*height_Year_1 + 2*height_Year_2 + 3*height_Year_3

  # Intercept and slope factors for variable 2 (weight)
  i_var2 =~ 1*weight_Baseline + 1*weight_Year_1 + 1*weight_Year_2 + 1*weight_Year_3
  s_var2 =~ 0*weight_Baseline + 1*weight_Year_1 + 2*weight_Year_2 + 3*weight_Year_3
"

# Fit the model using FIML for handling missing data
fit <- sem(model, data = df_wide, cluster = "site", missing = "fiml")

# Check the summary to identify potential issues
summary(fit, fit.measures = TRUE, standardized = TRUE, rsquare = TRUE)

```

This analysis utilized a multivariate (i.e., parallel process) latent growth curve model (LGCM) to study the progression of participants' height and weight across multiple time points, accounting for site-level clustering effects. The results revealed significant growth patterns in both height and weight. For height, the slope parameter was 2.46 (p < .001), indicating a steady increase in height across all assessment points. There was significant variability in the intercept (estimate = 8.94, se = 0.20, p < .001) and slope (estimate = 0.42, se = 0.06, p < .001), suggesting notable individual differences in starting heights and growth rates. The covariance between the intercept and slope was significant (estimate = -0.13, p = 0.037), indicating that higher initial heights are associated with lower growth rates.

For weight, similar growth patterns were observed, with the intercept and slope indicating steady increases in weight over time. The intercept for weight was estimated at 600.78 (se = 52.39, p < .001), and the slope was 43.06 (se = 3.73, p < .001). Covariances between height and weight processes were also significant: the covariance between the height intercept and weight intercept was 53.59 (p < .001), and the covariance between the height slope and weight slope was 2.15 (p = 0.010). These findings underscore the utility of parallel process LGCMs in capturing the dynamic interplay between multiple developmental processes, providing comprehensive insights into how individual differences in initial status and growth rates unfold over time.

### Model Plots
```{r}

# Calculate means for each time point for height and weight
mean_height <- df_wide %>%
    summarise(across(starts_with("height"), mean, na.rm = TRUE))

mean_weight <- df_wide %>%
    summarise(across(starts_with("weight"), mean, na.rm = TRUE))

# Reshape the data for plotting
mean_height_long <- pivot_longer(mean_height, cols = everything(), names_to = "Time", values_to = "Mean_Height")
mean_weight_long <- pivot_longer(mean_weight, cols = everything(), names_to = "Time", values_to = "Mean_Weight")

# Plot the mean trajectories for height
height_plot <- ggplot(mean_height_long, aes(x = Time, y = Mean_Height, group = 1)) +
    geom_line(color = "blue", size = 1.2) +
    geom_point(color = "blue") +
    labs(title = "Mean Growth Trajectory for Height", y = "Mean Height", x = "Time Point") +
    theme_minimal() +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

# Plot the mean trajectories for weight
weight_plot <- ggplot(mean_weight_long, aes(x = Time, y = Mean_Weight, group = 1)) +
    geom_line(color = "red", size = 1.2) +
    geom_point(color = "red") +
    labs(title = "Mean Growth Trajectory for Weight", y = "Mean Weight", x = "Time Point") +
    theme_minimal() +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

# Combine the plots side by side using patchwork
combined_plot <- height_plot + weight_plot
print(combined_plot)


```

The combined plot displays the mean growth trajectories for height and weight across multiple time points. The blue line and points represent the mean height, showing an upward trend over time, indicating steady growth. Similarly, the red line and points represent the mean weight, also demonstrating a continuous increase over the same time periods. 

## Wrapping Up
This analysis utilized a multivariate (parallel process) latent growth curve model (LGCM) to simultaneously examine the trajectories of participants' heights and weights across multiple assessment points. The results revealed an increasing trend in both mean height and weight over time. The slope parameter for height was 2.46 (p<.001), indicating consistent growth, while the slope parameter for weight was 6.56 (p<.001), reflecting substantial weight gain over the assessments. Significant variability was found in the intercepts for both height (estimate = 8.94, se = 0.20, p<.001) and weight (estimate = 600.78, se = 52.39, p<.001), as well as in the slopes for height (estimate = 0.42, se = 0.06, p<.001) and weight (estimate = 43.06, se = 3.73, p<.001). This indicates considerable individual differences in initial measurements and growth rates for both variables.

The significant negative covariance between the intercept and slope for height (estimate = -0.13, p = 0.037) suggests that participants with higher initial heights experienced slower subsequent growth. Additionally, the positive covariance between the intercepts of height and weight (estimate = 53.59, p<.001) and between the slopes of height and weight (estimate = 2.15, p = 0.010) indicates a relationship between the growth trajectories of height and weight, where higher initial heights and weights are associated with each other and similar growth patterns are observed over time.

Latent growth curve modeling in a multivariate framework provides an advanced method for simultaneously evaluating multiple growth trajectories, allowing for a deeper understanding of how different variables interact and change over time. This approach is particularly beneficial in developmental studies, offering insights into complex relationships and individual variability, thereby enhancing our ability to interpret longitudinal data comprehensively.
