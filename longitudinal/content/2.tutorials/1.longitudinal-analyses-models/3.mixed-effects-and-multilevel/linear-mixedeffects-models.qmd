### üèóÔ∏è Foundations

Linear Mixed-Effects Models, also known as linear mixed models (LMMs), are versatile statistical tools used to analyze data that involve both fixed effects and random effects. Fixed effects represent population-wide trends consistent across all observations, while random effects account for individual or group-level variability. LMMs are particularly useful for handling data with hierarchical or nested structures, such as measurements nested within individuals or individuals nested within groups. In situations where observations are correlated due to these nested structures, traditional linear regression models may not adequately account for the dependency among observations, potentially leading to biased estimates and invalid inferences.

In longitudinal analyses, LMMs are often preferred because they allow for individual-specific baselines and rates of change by incorporating random intercepts and slopes. This flexibility makes LMMs ideal for capturing both overall trends and individual variations, offering a more nuanced understanding of the data compared to simpler regression models. For example, in a study measuring students‚Äô academic performance over time, a linear mixed-effects model can include fixed effects for overall trends and random effects to account for individual differences in intercepts and slopes, modeling both the average effect and the individual deviations from that average. By partitioning the variance into components attributable to fixed and random effects, LMMs provide a flexible framework for analyzing complex data structures. They can handle unbalanced data, missing values, and varying numbers of observations, making them suitable for longitudinal studies and repeated measures designs.

### ü§î When to Use Linear Mixed Models (LMMs)?

You should consider using LMMs in the following scenarios:

1. You want to understand both overall population trends and individual variations over time.
2. Your outcome variable is measured repeatedly for the same subjects across multiple time points.
3. You have data with a hierarchical or nested data and need to account for correlated observations.

### üöÄ Getting Started with Longitudinal Linear Mixed Models

In this tutorial, we will introduce the concept of linear mixed-effects models (LMMs) and guide you through a simple example using a small dataset. By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:

1. Understand the basic structure of linear mixed models.
2. Fit a longitudinal linear mixed model using example data in R.
3. Interpret the results of the LMM analysis.

Let's dive in!

### üë©‚Äçüíª Hands-On Example 

For this tutorial, we will use a simple dataset containing the following information for a group of individuals:

- Subject ID
- Time (in years)
- Outcome variable (e.g., a measure of cognitive performance)

```r
# Generate a simple dataset
set.seed(123)
data <- data.frame(
  SubjectID = rep(1:5, each = 4),
  Time = rep(0:3, times = 5),
  Outcome = c(100, 105, 110, 115, 95, 100, 105, 110, 90, 95, 100, 105, 85, 90, 95, 100, 80, 85, 90, 95)
)

# View the first few rows
head(data)
```

#### Fitting Linear Mixed-Effects Models in R

We'll start by using the `lme4` package in R to fit a **random intercept model**, where each individual has their own baseline (intercept).

```r

# Load necessary libraries
library(lme4)

# Fit a random intercept model
model1 <- lmer(Outcome ~ Time + (1 | SubjectID), data = data)

# Display model summary to examine fixed and random effects
summary(model1)

```

#### Model Interpretation

In the output, the fixed effects provide the population-wide average relationship between the predictors (e.g., age) and the response variable (e.g., height). The random effects show how much individual subjects deviate from this average.

#### Adding Random Slopes

You can also allow for **random slopes**, meaning that individuals can differ not only in their intercepts (baselines) but also in their rate of change over time.

```r

# Load necessary libraries
library(lme4)

# Fit a random slope model
model2 <- lmer(Outcome ~ Time + (Time | SubjectID), data = data)

# Display model summary to examine fixed and random effects
summary(model2)

```

Now, each child has their own growth rate!

#### Model Diagnostics and Visualization

Once we‚Äôve fitted our models, we need to assess how well they fit the data.

##### Model Fit: AIC, BIC, and Likelihood Ratio Tests

One way to assess model fit is by comparing models using **AIC** (Akaike Information Criterion) or **BIC** (Bayesian Information Criterion). A lower AIC or BIC indicates a better model fit.

```r
# Comparing model fit
AIC(model1, model2)
```

#### Residual Diagnostics

Check the residuals to ensure that the assumptions of normality and homoscedasticity hold.

```r
# Plot residuals
plot(model2)
```

If the residuals are roughly normally distributed and homoscedastic, the model is well-fitted.

#### Visualization

Visualizing both the raw data and the fitted model is key for understanding your results.

##### Plotting Raw Data

Use `ggplot2` to visualize the data points and individual growth trajectories.

```r
# Load ggplot2 library
library(ggplot2)

# Plot raw data
ggplot(data, aes(x = Time, y = Outcome, color = factor(SubjectID))) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
    labs(
        title = "Raw Data: Individual Growth Trajectories",
        x = "Time (years)",
        y = "Outcome",
        color = "Subject ID"
    )

```

##### Plotting Predicted Values

Next, plot the predicted growth curves for each individual based on the model:

```r
# Add predicted values to the dataset
data$pred <- predict(model2)

# Plot predicted values
ggplot(data, aes(x = Time, y = pred, color = factor(SubjectID))) +
    geom_line() +
    labs(
        title = "Predicted Growth Curves by Subject",
        x = "Time (years)",
        y = "Predicted Outcome",
        color = "Subject ID"
    )

```
