### 🏗️ Foundations

Autoregressive Cross-Lagged (ARCL) models are valuable tools for analyzing the reciprocal relationships between variables over time. ARCL models estimate how a variable at an earlier time point influences itself at later time points (autoregressive paths), as well as how one variable influences another variable across time (cross-lagged paths). This type of analysis is especially useful for testing the directionality of relationships over time and understanding how two variables dynamically influence each other.

ARCL models provide insights into whether changes in one variable predict changes in another over time and whether the relationship between two variables is reciprocal.

### 🤔 When to Use Autoregressive Cross-Lagged Models?

You might consider using ARCL models when:

1. You have two or more variables measured repeatedly over time.
2. You are interested in understanding reciprocal or bidirectional relationships between variables.
3. You want to assess how one variable influences another at future time points.

### 🚀 Getting Started with Autoregressive Cross-Lagged Models

In this tutorial, we will guide you through a simple example of how to apply ARCL models in R. By the end of this tutorial, you will:

1. Understand the basic concept of ARCL models.
2. Fit an ARCL model to longitudinal data using R.
3. Interpret the results and visualize the cross-lagged relationships.

### 👩‍💻 Hands-On Example

#### Dataset

We will use a dataset with two variables, **Variable A** and **Variable B**, measured over three time points. The dataset includes:

- **SubjectID**: A unique identifier for each individual.
- **Variable A**: Measured at three time points.
- **Variable B**: Measured at three time points.

```r
# Generate a simple dataset
set.seed(123)
data <- data.frame(
  SubjectID = 1:10,
  A_T1 = rnorm(10, mean = 50, sd = 10),
  A_T2 = rnorm(10, mean = 52, sd = 10),
  A_T3 = rnorm(10, mean = 54, sd = 10),
  B_T1 = rnorm(10, mean = 30, sd = 5),
  B_T2 = rnorm(10, mean = 31, sd = 5),
  B_T3 = rnorm(10, mean = 32, sd = 5)
)

# View the first few rows of the dataset
head(data)
```

#### Fitting an Autoregressive Cross-Lagged Model in R

We will use the `lavaan` package to specify and fit the ARCL model. In this example, we estimate autoregressive paths for **Variable A** and **Variable B** and cross-lagged paths between them.

```r
# Install and load necessary library
if (!require(lavaan)) install.packages("lavaan")
library(lavaan)

# Define the ARCL model
arcl_model <- '
  # Autoregressive paths
  A_T2 ~ A_T1
  A_T3 ~ A_T2
  B_T2 ~ B_T1
  B_T3 ~ B_T2

  # Cross-lagged paths
  B_T2 ~ A_T1
  B_T3 ~ A_T2
  A_T2 ~ B_T1
  A_T3 ~ B_T2
'

# Fit the ARCL model
fit <- sem(arcl_model, data = data)

# Display model summary
summary(fit, fit.measures = TRUE)
```

#### Model Interpretation

The autoregressive paths represent the stability of each variable over time, while the cross-lagged paths capture how one variable influences the other at later time points. A significant cross-lagged path suggests that changes in one variable predict changes in the other.

#### Visualizing the Relationships

Visualizing the estimated relationships can help illustrate how the variables influence each other across time points.

```r
# Load ggplot2 library for visualization
library(ggplot2)

# Plot the time-series data for Variable A and Variable B
data_long <- reshape2::melt(data, id.vars = "SubjectID", variable.name = "Time_Variable", value.name = "Score")
data_long$Time <- as.numeric(sub(".*_(T)", "", data_long$Time_Variable))
data_long$Variable <- sub("_T.*", "", data_long$Time_Variable)

ggplot(data_long, aes(x = Time, y = Score, color = Variable)) +
  geom_line(aes(group = interaction(SubjectID, Variable))) +
  facet_wrap(~SubjectID) +
  labs(
    title = "Time-Series Data for Variable A and Variable B",
    x = "Time",
    y = "Score"
  )
```

### 🛝 Exercises

Try adding more time points or additional variables to the ARCL model and explore how the relationships change.
