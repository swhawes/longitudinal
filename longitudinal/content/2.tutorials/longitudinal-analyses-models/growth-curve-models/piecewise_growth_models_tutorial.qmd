### üèóÔ∏è Foundations

Piecewise Growth Models (PGMs) allow for the estimation of growth trajectories that can change at one or more points over time. Rather than assuming a single growth trajectory across the entire time period, PGMs break the trajectory into distinct "pieces," each of which can have its own growth rate. This is particularly useful when you expect that the growth pattern changes at known times, such as after an intervention or a significant life event.

Piecewise growth models are widely used in longitudinal studies to capture changes in growth patterns over specific time periods.

### ü§î When to Use Piecewise Growth Models?

Piecewise Growth Models are useful when:

1. You believe that growth trajectories may change at specific points in time, such as before and after an intervention.
2. You want to estimate separate growth rates for different time intervals.
3. You have repeated measures data with potential shifts in the rate of change over time.

### üöÄ Getting Started with Piecewise Growth Models

In this tutorial, you will:

1. Understand how to set up and fit a piecewise growth model.
2. Fit a PGM in R using a simple dataset with two growth segments.
3. Interpret the results to understand how the growth rates change over time.

### üë©‚Äçüíª Hands-On Example

#### Dataset

We will generate a dataset where an outcome variable is measured at six time points. The first three time points will represent a pre-intervention phase, and the last three will represent a post-intervention phase. The goal is to model different growth rates before and after the intervention.

- **SubjectID**: A unique identifier for each individual.
- **Time**: Time in years (ranging from 1 to 6).
- **Outcome**: The outcome variable measured over time.

```r
# Generate a simple dataset
set.seed(123)
data <- data.frame(
  SubjectID = rep(1:50, each = 6),
  Time = rep(1:6, times = 50),
  Outcome = c(rep(rnorm(50, mean = 50, sd = 5), 3), rep(rnorm(50, mean = 60, sd = 5), 3))
)

# View the first few rows
head(data)
```

#### Fitting a Piecewise Growth Model in R

We will use the `lme4` package in R to fit a piecewise growth model. We will define two segments: one for time points 1-3 (pre-intervention) and one for time points 4-6 (post-intervention).

```r
# Load necessary libraries
library(lme4)

# Define time segments: 1-3 (pre) and 4-6 (post)
data$Pre_Post <- ifelse(data$Time <= 3, 0, 1)

# Fit a piecewise growth model
model <- lmer(Outcome ~ Time + Pre_Post + Time:Pre_Post + (1 | SubjectID), data = data)

# Display model summary
summary(model)
```

#### Model Interpretation

The model estimates separate growth rates for the pre-intervention and post-intervention periods. The interaction term **Time:Pre_Post** tells us how the growth rate changes after the intervention.

#### Visualizing the Growth Trajectories

We can plot the growth trajectories to visualize how the rate of change differs before and after the intervention.

```r
# Load ggplot2 for visualization
library(ggplot2)

# Plot individual growth trajectories and group means
ggplot(data, aes(x = Time, y = Outcome, group = SubjectID)) +
  geom_line(alpha = 0.4) +
  stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = "line", color = "blue", size = 1.2) +
  labs(
    title = "Piecewise Growth Model: Pre- and Post-Intervention Trajectories",
    x = "Time (Years)",
    y = "Outcome"
  )
```

### üõù Exercises

Experiment with changing the time point where the intervention occurs or adding more time segments to model more complex growth patterns. You can also explore adding covariates to explain variability in the growth rates between individuals.

### üí≠ Final Thoughts

Piecewise Growth Models are a powerful tool for modeling growth trajectories that change at specific points in time. By breaking the growth trajectory into segments, you can capture shifts in the rate of change, making these models particularly useful when studying interventions or life events.
