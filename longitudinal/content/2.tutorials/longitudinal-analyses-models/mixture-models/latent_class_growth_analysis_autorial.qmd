### 🏗️ Foundations

Latent Class Growth Analysis (LCGA) is used to identify distinct subgroups (latent classes) within a population based on their growth trajectories over time. LCGA assumes that individuals within each class share a similar growth pattern, but the patterns can vary between classes. This method is particularly useful in identifying heterogeneity in longitudinal data, revealing underlying subgroups that may follow different developmental trajectories.

LCGA is widely applied in psychological, educational, and social research to identify subpopulations that have distinct patterns of change over time.

### 🤔 When to Use Latent Class Growth Analysis?

LCGA is useful when:

1. You believe there are unobserved subgroups in the population with distinct growth trajectories.
2. You want to identify and describe these latent classes based on their growth patterns.
3. You have repeated measures data and wish to model heterogeneity in growth over time.

### 🚀 Getting Started with Latent Class Growth Analysis

In this tutorial, you will:

1. Understand how LCGA identifies latent subgroups based on growth trajectories.
2. Fit an LCGA model in R using example data.
3. Interpret the results to identify distinct latent classes.

### 👩‍💻 Hands-On Example

#### Dataset

We will use a dataset where an outcome variable is measured at three time points. LCGA will help us identify distinct latent classes based on how individuals' outcomes change over time.

- **SubjectID**: A unique identifier for each individual.
- **Outcome_T1**: The outcome variable measured at time 1.
- **Outcome_T2**: The outcome variable measured at time 2.
- **Outcome_T3**: The outcome variable measured at time 3.

```r
# Generate a simple dataset
set.seed(123)
data <- data.frame(
  SubjectID = 1:100,
  Outcome_T1 = c(rnorm(50, mean = 50, sd = 10), rnorm(50, mean = 70, sd = 10)),
  Outcome_T2 = c(rnorm(50, mean = 52, sd = 10), rnorm(50, mean = 72, sd = 10)),
  Outcome_T3 = c(rnorm(50, mean = 55, sd = 10), rnorm(50, mean = 75, sd = 10))
)

# View the first few rows
head(data)
```

#### Fitting a Latent Class Growth Analysis Model in R

We will use the `lcmm` package in R to fit an LCGA model, where we estimate growth trajectories for distinct latent classes.

```r
# Install and load necessary library
if (!require(lcmm)) install.packages("lcmm")
library(lcmm)

# Fit an LCGA model with 2 latent classes
lcga_model <- hlme(fixed = Outcome_T1 + Outcome_T2 + Outcome_T3 ~ 1, subject = "SubjectID", ng = 2, data = data)

# Display the model summary
summary(lcga_model)
```

#### Model Interpretation

The model will estimate the growth trajectories for each latent class. Based on the class membership probabilities, we can identify which individuals are most likely to belong to each class. The differences in the growth patterns between classes will reveal the heterogeneity in the population.

#### Visualizing the Latent Classes

Visualizing the growth trajectories for each latent class can help us understand how the classes differ over time.

```r
# Load ggplot2 for visualization
library(ggplot2)

# Plot the mean growth trajectories for each latent class
class_assignments <- predict(lcga_model, class = TRUE)
data$class <- factor(class_assignments$class)

ggplot(data, aes(x = factor(c(1, 2, 3)), y = Outcome_T1, group = SubjectID, color = class)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = Outcome_T1)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = Outcome_T2)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = Outcome_T3)) +
  labs(
    title = "Latent Class Growth Trajectories",
    x = "Time",
    y = "Outcome",
    color = "Latent Class"
  )
```

### 🛝 Exercises

Try modifying the number of latent classes or adding covariates to the model. Explore how different numbers of classes change the interpretation of the growth trajectories.

### 💭 Final Thoughts

Latent Class Growth Analysis is a powerful tool for uncovering hidden subgroups within a population based on their growth patterns. By identifying distinct latent classes, you can gain insights into heterogeneity that may be masked when looking at the population as a whole.
