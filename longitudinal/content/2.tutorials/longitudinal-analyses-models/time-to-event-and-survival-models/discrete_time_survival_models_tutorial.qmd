### 🏗️ Foundations

Discrete-Time Survival Models are a useful tool for modeling the time until an event occurs in discrete time intervals. Unlike continuous survival models, which assume that the event can happen at any point in time, discrete-time survival models are ideal when events are observed at specific time points (e.g., yearly or monthly). These models can handle data where events such as graduation, job changes, or health outcomes are recorded in time intervals.

Survival models are used in a variety of disciplines to understand not only *if* an event occurs, but *when* it occurs, while accounting for individuals who may not experience the event by the end of the study (i.e., censoring).

### 🤔 When to Use Discrete-Time Survival Models?

Use Discrete-Time Survival Models when:

1. You are studying time-to-event data where the event occurs in discrete intervals (e.g., years, months).
2. You need to account for censoring, where some individuals do not experience the event by the end of the study.
3. You want to understand the timing of events and what factors influence the hazard (or risk) of an event occurring at a specific time point.

### 🚀 Getting Started with Discrete-Time Survival Models

In this tutorial, we will guide you through:

1. Understanding the structure of a Discrete-Time Survival Model.
2. Fitting a Discrete-Time Survival Model in R using a simple dataset.
3. Interpreting the results to understand the time-to-event process.

### 👩‍💻 Hands-On Example

#### Dataset

We will work with a dataset where we observe whether an event (e.g., job loss) occurs at specific time points for each individual. Some individuals are censored, meaning that they did not experience the event by the end of the study.

- **SubjectID**: A unique identifier for each individual.
- **Time**: The time point (in years).
- **Event**: A binary variable indicating whether the event occurred (1) or did not occur (0).
- **Censored**: A binary variable indicating whether the individual was censored (1 = yes, 0 = no).

```r
# Generate a simple dataset
set.seed(123)
data <- data.frame(
  SubjectID = rep(1:100, each = 5),
  Time = rep(0:4, times = 100),
  Event = rbinom(500, 1, 0.2),
  Censored = rbinom(500, 1, 0.1)
)

# View the first few rows
head(data)
```

#### Fitting a Discrete-Time Survival Model in R

We will use the `survival` package in R to fit a Discrete-Time Survival Model. This model will estimate the hazard of experiencing the event at each time point while accounting for censoring.

```r
# Install and load necessary library
if (!require(survival)) install.packages("survival")
library(survival)

# Define the survival object
surv_object <- Surv(time = data$Time, event = data$Event)

# Fit the discrete-time survival model
model <- coxph(surv_object ~ Time, data = data)

# Display model summary
summary(model)
```

#### Model Interpretation

The hazard ratios from the model output indicate how the risk of experiencing the event changes over time. A hazard ratio greater than 1 means that the risk increases over time, while a hazard ratio less than 1 indicates a decreasing risk.

#### Visualizing the Survival Function

We can plot the survival function over time to visualize how the probability of surviving (i.e., not experiencing the event) changes over time.

```r
# Plot the survival function
plot(survfit(model), xlab = "Time", ylab = "Survival Probability", main = "Discrete-Time Survival Function")
```

### 🛝 Exercises

Experiment with adding covariates to the model to see how factors like age or income influence the hazard of the event. You can also explore models with time-varying covariates to account for changes in risk over time.

### 💭 Final Thoughts

Discrete-Time Survival Models are a powerful tool for modeling time-to-event data in discrete intervals. By accounting for censoring and estimating the hazard of events, these models provide insights into the timing of events and the factors that influence them.
