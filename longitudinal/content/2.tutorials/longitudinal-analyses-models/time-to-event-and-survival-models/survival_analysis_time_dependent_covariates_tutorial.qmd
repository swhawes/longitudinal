### 🏗️ Foundations

Survival analysis is a set of statistical approaches used to model time-to-event data, where the event of interest can be anything from patient death to equipment failure. When covariates change over time, these are known as time-dependent covariates. Incorporating time-dependent covariates into survival analysis allows for more flexible and realistic models of how predictors influence the hazard of an event occurring over time.

Time-dependent covariates provide the opportunity to update the information about predictors as new data becomes available, offering a dynamic view of the risks or survival times.

### 🤔 When to Use Survival Analysis with Time-Dependent Covariates?

Use this type of analysis when:

1. You have time-to-event data, and you want to model when an event happens.
2. One or more of your covariates change over time, such as blood pressure or medication status.
3. You need to account for how changing covariates influence the hazard rate over time.

### 🚀 Getting Started with Survival Analysis and Time-Dependent Covariates

In this tutorial, we will:

1. Review how to fit a survival model with time-dependent covariates using R.
2. Use a dataset with repeated measurements for a covariate to demonstrate how time-dependent variables are incorporated into survival models.

### 👩‍💻 Hands-On Example

#### Dataset

We will create a dataset where we measure the time until an event (e.g., patient death), along with a time-dependent covariate (e.g., blood pressure). The dataset includes:

- **SubjectID**: A unique identifier for each subject.
- **StartTime**: The start of each interval.
- **StopTime**: The end of each interval.
- **Event**: Whether the event occurred at the stop time (1 = event, 0 = censored).
- **TimeDependentCov**: A time-dependent covariate (e.g., blood pressure) measured at each time interval.

```r
# Generate a simple dataset
set.seed(123)
data <- data.frame(
  SubjectID = rep(1:10, each = 4),
  StartTime = rep(seq(0, 9, by = 3), times = 10),
  StopTime = rep(seq(3, 12, by = 3), times = 10),
  Event = rbinom(40, 1, 0.3),
  TimeDependentCov = rnorm(40, mean = 120, sd = 10)
)

# View the first few rows
head(data)
```

#### Fitting a Cox Proportional Hazards Model with Time-Dependent Covariates

We will use the `survival` package in R to fit a Cox Proportional Hazards Model that includes time-dependent covariates.

```r
# Install and load necessary library
if (!require(survival)) install.packages("survival")
library(survival)

# Fit a Cox model with time-dependent covariates
cox_model <- coxph(Surv(StartTime, StopTime, Event) ~ TimeDependentCov + cluster(SubjectID), data = data)

# Display the model summary
summary(cox_model)
```

#### Model Interpretation

The results of the Cox model with time-dependent covariates provide estimates of how the hazard of the event changes as the covariate changes over time. For example, a positive coefficient for the time-dependent covariate indicates that higher values of the covariate are associated with an increased hazard of the event occurring.

#### Visualizing the Results

We can visualize the effect of the time-dependent covariate on the hazard rate using Kaplan-Meier curves or predicted survival curves.

```r
# Fit a Kaplan-Meier survival curve for visualization
km_fit <- survfit(Surv(StartTime, StopTime, Event) ~ TimeDependentCov, data = data)

# Plot the survival curve
plot(km_fit, xlab = "Time", ylab = "Survival Probability", main = "Kaplan-Meier Survival Curve")
```

### 🛝 Exercises

Try experimenting with different types of time-dependent covariates, or add more time points to see how the hazard changes with time-varying predictors.

### 💭 Final Thoughts

You’ve learned how to incorporate time-dependent covariates into survival analysis, offering a dynamic way to assess how changing predictors influence the risk of an event over time. Survival analysis with time-dependent covariates is an essential tool when covariates do not remain constant throughout the study.
