### 🏗️ Foundations

Time-Varying Covariates Models (TVCM) are used to examine how covariates that change over time influence an outcome variable. These models allow for the inclusion of covariates that fluctuate across different time points and assess their relationship with the growth or change of the outcome variable. By explicitly modeling these time-varying effects, TVCM can capture dynamic influences on the outcome variable across the duration of the study.

TVCM is particularly useful in studies where the covariates of interest (e.g., stress, income, or health) vary across time and may affect the trajectory of an outcome.

### 🤔 When to Use Time-Varying Covariates Models?

Consider using TVCM when:

1. You have covariates that vary across time.
2. You are interested in how changes in these covariates affect an outcome variable over time.
3. You are analyzing longitudinal data where the influence of covariates is not static but changes across different time points.

### 🚀 Getting Started with Time-Varying Covariates Models

In this tutorial, you will learn how to:

1. Understand the structure of a Time-Varying Covariates Model.
2. Fit a TVCM in R using example data.
3. Interpret the results to understand the effects of time-varying covariates on an outcome variable.

### 👩‍💻 Hands-On Example

#### Dataset

We will use a dataset where the outcome variable and covariate are measured at three time points. TVCM will help us model how the time-varying covariate influences the outcome at different points in time.

- **SubjectID**: A unique identifier for each individual.
- **Outcome_T1, Outcome_T2, Outcome_T3**: The outcome variable measured at times 1, 2, and 3.
- **Covariate_T1, Covariate_T2, Covariate_T3**: The time-varying covariate measured at times 1, 2, and 3.

```r
# Generate a simple dataset
set.seed(123)
data <- data.frame(
  SubjectID = 1:100,
  Outcome_T1 = rnorm(100, mean = 50, sd = 10),
  Outcome_T2 = rnorm(100, mean = 52, sd = 10),
  Outcome_T3 = rnorm(100, mean = 54, sd = 10),
  Covariate_T1 = rnorm(100, mean = 30, sd = 5),
  Covariate_T2 = rnorm(100, mean = 32, sd = 5),
  Covariate_T3 = rnorm(100, mean = 34, sd = 5)
)

# View the first few rows
head(data)
```

#### Fitting a Time-Varying Covariates Model in R

We will use the `lavaan` package in R to fit a TVCM. The model will include the time-varying covariate as a predictor of the outcome variable at each time point.

```r
# Install and load necessary library
if (!require(lavaan)) install.packages("lavaan")
library(lavaan)

# Define the TVCM model
tvcm_model <- '
  # Time-varying covariate effects
  Outcome_T2 ~ Outcome_T1 + Covariate_T1
  Outcome_T3 ~ Outcome_T2 + Covariate_T2
'

# Fit the TVCM
fit <- lavaan::sem(tvcm_model, data = data)

# Display the model summary
summary(fit, fit.measures = TRUE)
```

#### Model Interpretation

The model estimates the effects of the time-varying covariate at each time point. By examining these effects, we can understand how changes in the covariate influence the outcome variable over time.

#### Visualizing the Effect of the Time-Varying Covariate

We can plot both the outcome and covariate trajectories to visualize how changes in the covariate are associated with changes in the outcome.

```r
# Load ggplot2 for visualization
library(ggplot2)

# Reshape data for visualization
data_long <- reshape2::melt(data, id.vars = "SubjectID", variable.name = "Time", value.name = "Value")
data_long$Time <- as.numeric(sub(".*_T", "", data_long$Time))

# Plot individual trajectories for outcome and covariate
ggplot(data_long, aes(x = Time, y = Value, group = SubjectID, color = variable)) +
  geom_line(alpha = 0.4) +
  labs(
    title = "Time-Varying Covariates Model: Outcome and Covariate Trajectories",
    x = "Time",
    y = "Value",
    color = "Variable"
  )
```

### 🛝 Exercises

Experiment with adding additional time-varying covariates or modeling interactions between covariates. You can also explore fitting more complex models with non-linear effects of covariates on the outcome.

### 💭 Final Thoughts

Time-Varying Covariates Models are a valuable tool for modeling the dynamic influence of covariates on an outcome variable over time. By incorporating time-varying effects, TVCM allows researchers to capture more nuanced relationships between covariates and outcomes in longitudinal studies.
