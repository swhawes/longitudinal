## About the ABCD Study

The [ABCD Study](https://abcdstudy.org/) is the largest long-term study of brain development and child health in the United States. It aims to understand the many factors that can influence brain, cognitive, social, and emotional development. By following over 11,000 youth from ages 9 to 18, the study collects data on a variety of measures including neuroimaging, cognitive assessments, and clinical evaluations. This extensive and diverse data set provides an unprecedented opportunity to study the developmental trajectories of children and adolescents.

The data from the ABCD Study are publicly available and updated annually, making it a valuable resource for researchers worldwide. The study's prospective design and large sample size allow for robust analysis of developmental trends and the impact of various factors on brain and behavioral outcomes. Detailed documentation and protocols are provided to facilitate effective use of the data in research.
